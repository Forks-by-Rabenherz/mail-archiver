## üåê Overview

The Mail Archiver application supports Microsoft 365 (M365) accounts using OAuth2 client credentials flow for email retrieval. Additionally, it provides retention policy functionality to automatically delete emails from the mail server after a specified period, helping manage storage space while maintaining a complete archive.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure App Registration for Email Retrieval

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Administrative access to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- A Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online licenses

### üöÄ Create App Registration

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com)
2. Sign in with your administrator account
3. In the left navigation pane, select **App registrations**
4. Click **+ New registration** at the top of the App registrations page
5. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Mail Archiver M365 Provider")
   - **Supported account types**: Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** (Single tenant)
     - This is required for the client credentials flow used by Mail Archiver
   - **Redirect URI**: Leave this blank (not needed for client credentials flow)
6. Click **Register**

**Important**: Note down the following values from the **Overview** page:
- **Application (client) ID** - You'll need this as `ClientId` in Mail Archiver
- **Directory (tenant) ID** - You'll need this as `TenantId` in Mail Archiver

### üîê Set Required API Permissions

1. Navigate to **API permissions** in the left menu
2. Click **+ Add a permission**

6. Click **Add permissions**
7. **CRITICAL**: Click **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]**

3. Provide a description (e.g., "Mail Archiver Secret")
